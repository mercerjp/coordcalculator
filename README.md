# coordcalculator
Another university project which was to create methods to which performed functions on geometric sets of coordinates.
slope_from_origin(self), which returns the slope of the line joining the origin to the
point. It returns False if the slope cannot be calculated.
get_line_to(self; p), which returns the straight line equation between this point object
(self), and another point p. The coefficients of the line y = ax + b must be returned
as a tuple of values (a; b). It returns False if the line equation cannot be calculated.
